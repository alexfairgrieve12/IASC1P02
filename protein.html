  		<p id="title">Protein</p>

  		<p class="text">Our body contains thousands of different proteins each with a unique function. The building blocks are nitrogen containing molecules called amino acids. There are 20 amino acids - If your cells have all 20 amino acids available in ample amounts you can make a lot of proteins. There 9 of amino acids are essential, meaning we need to take them in from our diet.
</br>

Proteins act as enzymes. Enzymes speed up chemical actions such as digestions of carbs and synthesis of cholesterol by liver. They speed reactions up so much that if you donâ€™t have some enzymes it can be bad. Proteins are hormones, they are chemicals that are created in one part of the body and carry the message to another organ or part of the body. For example, glucagon and insulin hormones that are made in pancreas and travel throughout body to regulate blood glucose. Proteins provide structure to things in the body such as collagen, it gives structure to bones teeth and skin. Proteins are antibodies, they fight against bacteria, viruses, other invaders. Antibodies are blood proteins that attack and neutralize these invaders. Protein maintains intracellular fluid (within cells) intravascular fluid (in the blood) interstitial fluid (in between cells) balance. Fluid also flows between these spaces, proteins and minerals that keep them in balance. Proteins are too big to pass across membranes separating the compartments but since protein ATTRACT WATER they act to maintain proper fluid balance. If one does not obtain enough protein the blood protein levels will not be maintained and fluid will leak into the surrounding tissues and cause swelling called EDEMA. Proteins are transporters because they transport nutrients and other compounds: pros inside cell membranes pump compounds in and out of cell, others attach themselves to nutrients or other molecules to transport them to other parts of the body ex hemoglobin carries O2. Protein maintains acid-base balance. They act as buffers and are an extra energy source. Protein can be used from your muscles and other tissues or from the diet to make new glucose from amino acids (gluconeogenesis).

Protein is constantly broken down and re-synthesized. Our bodies reuse most of released AAs but small portion is lost and must be replaced in diet. Requirement reflects lost amount of AAs & any increased needs for growth / illness. The RDA (recommended dietary allowance) for Adults = 0.8g/kg, for Infants (because of growth) = 1.5g/kg, during Pregnancy = 1.1g/kg, someone who participates in Physical activity, and for Athletes: Endurance = 1.4g/kg / Strength = 1.7g/kg. The Acceptable macronutrient range (AMDR) men and women = 19+ 10-35% of calories, for children = 4+ 10-30% / younger children 5-20%, and for the Elderly = 1.2g/kg - to prevent muscle loss and osteoporosis. Vegetarians have a diet that excludes all animal products including eggs and dairy. Therefore they need to take extra caution when they are eating because most meats are where we get our source of protein.
