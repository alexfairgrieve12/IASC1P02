  		<p id="title">Vitamins</p>

  		<p class="text">The first vitamins we are going to talk about are water-soluble which means that they are able to dissolve in water.
Many B vits help in energy yielding chemical reactions (help get calories from food), but they are not energy boosters.
</br>
</br>
B1: Thiamin:
</br>
<b>Function:</b> assists in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes:</b> more cals consumed greater need for it – more cals consumed the more you automatically consume – RDA for women = 1.1mg men = 1.2mg
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> fortified breakfast cereals, enriched grains (rice, pasta), port, beans, peas
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> No known toxicity symptoms, Deficiency not common – but alcoholics and junk food heavy diet are at risk – no nutrients and alcohol interferes with absorption, Deficiency disease = “beriberi” – weight loss, confusion, irritability, nerve damage, muscle wasting
</br></br>
B2: Riboflavin
</br>
<b>Function:</b> assists in carbohydrate and fat metabolism
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes:</b> RDA reflects energy need – with high riboflavin intakes recommended for those who calorie needs are higher – RDA women = 1.1mg men = 1.3 mg
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> dairy products, fortified cereals, enriched grains = major - mushrooms, organ meats (liver) = additional
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> Body excretes excess – no toxicity symptoms, Deficiency = uncommon – alcoholism increases individual’s, Symptoms = swollen mouth, throat, dermatitis/ eczema (inflammation of skin), and anemia
</br></br>
Niacin – Nicotinamide, Nicotinic Acid
</br>
<b>Functions:</b> assisted in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, helps with cell differentiation, participates in DNA replication and repair
</br>
<b>Recommended Intakes:</b> RDA women = 14mg – men = 16mg
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> meat, poultry, fish, fortified breakfast cereals, enriched grains
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> Large doses lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HAL (good) cholesterol – may be prescribed from cholesterol management – but people don’t like the side effects = flushing or itching, heat and tingling on face and upper body Potential for liver damage Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults = 35mg/day Severe deficiency leads to the disease pellagra characterized by the four D’s – dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, eventually death Deficiency is rare
</br></br>

B6 – Pridoxine, Pyridoxal, Pyridoxamine:
</br>
<b>Functions:</b> assists in protein and carbohydrate metabolism – supports blood cell synthesis and neurotransmitter synthesis
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes of B6:</b> diets high in protein require increase B6 (because it assisted in pro metabolism – RDA for men and women = 1.3mg until age 51 hen it increases to men = 1.7mg/day & women = 1.5mg/day
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> fortified breakfast cereals, bananas, chickpeas, white potatoes, sunflower seeds, beef, poultry
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> Large doses cause nerve damage that may be irreversible, UL = 100mg/day, Alcoholism increases risk of deficiency, Deficiencies are rare Symptoms = anemia, dermatitis, depression, confusion and convulsions
</br></br>
B12 – Cobalamin:
</br>
<b>Functions:</b> participates in metabolism of folate, helps protect myelin sheath (coating that surrounds and protects nerve fibers)
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes of B12:</b> RDA = 2.4mg for men and women
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> fish, beef, poultry, dairy, fortified breakfast cereals and fortified (enriched with vitamins and minerals) soy products - NO SOURCES in vegetables
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> No known toxicity effects Can store B12 in liver to last TWO YEARS Older people at risk because many have a stomach condition that decreased absorption of this vitamin Too little causes type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia Red blood cells grow very large and have short life span because B12 role in protecting myelin sheath a deficiency causes neurological symptoms including tingling, numbness, cognitive changes, disorientation and dementia – defects may or may not be reversible Pernicious anemia is for of B12 deficiency resulting from an autoimmune disease that damages stomach and inhibits B12 absorption – treated with B12 injections
</br>
</br>
Folate – Folic Acid (synthetic form):
</br>
<b>Functions:</b> assists in DNA synthesis and cell division – participates in AAs metabolism – required for maturation of cells including RBCs
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes:</b> RDA men and women = 400micrograms – Pregnancy = 600micrograms
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> fortified breakfast cereals, enriched grains, legumes, green leafy veggies, orange juice, wheat germ and liver
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> Excess = mask a deficiency of B12 by reversing or preventing anemia Neurological effects of lack of B12 still continue without early obvious signs UL adults = 1,000micrograms from folic acids supplements and fortified food Because folate is required for cell division, too little causes megaloblastic anemia just as a lack of B12 does Inadequate stores and intake linked to increased risks of birth defects like spina bifida and anencephaly (neural tube defect in which all or part of brain is missing) Low intake is linked to increased risk of heart disease and cancer
</br>
</br>
C: Ascorbic Acid
</br>
<b>Functions:</b> enhances iron absorption, helps with collagen synthesis, acts as an antioxidant, regenerates vitamin E, plays a role in immune function, assists in synthesis of neurotransmitters, DNA and hormones Treatment or prevention of common cold: research does not suggest that VC supplements prevent colds – however among those subjected to extreme cold or engaging in extreme PA, VC doses ranging between 250mg/day to 1000mg/day reduced the incidence of colds by 50% - taken before onset of cold, VC supplement appears to slightly reduce length of cold
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes:</b> RDA for men = 90mg – women = 75 mg / smokers should add 35mg/day
</br>
<b>Sources:</b> fruits and veggies, bell peppers, citrus fruit, strawberries, pineapple, kiwifruit, potatoes, tomatoes, broccoli, leafy greens
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> UL is 2,000mg Excess = nosebleeds, nausea, gastrointestinal distress = cramps and diarrhea People with kidney disease = too much may lead to kidney stones Large doses may increase oxidation within body = opposite effect of its antioxidant role Deficiency = “scurvy” = characterized by bleeding in gums, small hemorrhages on arms and legs, bone pain, fractures and depression
</br>
</br>
Fat Soluble (able to dissolve in fats) accumulate in liver and fat tissues – reserves may be released with dietary intakes are low – research suggest blood levels of VD may be low even in presence of significant storage – because stored readily, may be toxic in large doses
<br>
<br>

A – retinaol, retinal, retinoic acid, provitamin A – Carotenoids:
</br>
<b>Functions: </b>required for night vision and colour vision, needed for cell differentiation, supports immune function, aids both male and female reproductive processes, required for bone health
</br>
Additional functions: research is mounting that carotenoid have health benefits – lutein and zeaxanthin may protect the eye from cataract and age related macular degeneration – lycopene, crytoxanthin, beta-carotene and alpha-carotene might be cancer-protective
</br>
<b>Recommended intake:</b> RDA 14+ male = 900micrograms – female = 700micrograms
</br>
<b>Sources: </b> preformed VA come from animals food only – liver, egg yolks, whole milk – carotenoids are precursors to VA referred to as provitamin A = broccoli, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, peaches, other dark green and yellow/orange fruits and vegetables
</br>
<b>Too much/too little: </b> UL = 3000micrograms Excess preformed VA can cause birth defects = cleft palate and spontaneous abortions
Pregnant should not take supplements or medications containing preformed VA (retinol) – should use pre-natal supplements that have beta-carotene as Vit A source High doses linked to increased hip fractures in older women Excess beta-carotene can cause carotenodermia, harmless condition that turns skin yellowish in colour Even though beta-carotene is an antioxidant – supplements may increase risk of lung cancer among smokers Too little may cause night blindness and even permanent blindness, increased infections, impaired growth and reproductive function
<br>
<br>

D: Cholecalciferol
<b>Functions: </b> regulated blood calcium levels & bone support
<b>Recommended intakes:</b> AI for males and females aged 1-70 = 600IU (international units) – after age 70 AI jumps to 800IU
<b>Sources: </b>sunlight (ultra violet light triggers synthesis of VD in skin) fatty fish, egg yolks, beef liver and some mushrooms – additional sources = fortified milk, orange juice, breakfast cereals
<b>Too much/too little: </b> UL for adults and kids 9+ = 4,000 IU Excess can cause hypercalcemia – dangerously high levels of calcium in blood – can cause bone loss and kidney stones – may also affect nervous system, heart, lungs, kidneys and blood vessels Deficiency results in weak bones – in kids = “rickets” = bowlegs and other skeletal deficiencies – in adults =  causes bone fractures
<br>
<br>

E: Tocopherol
</br>
<b>Functions: </b>protects cell membranes from oxidation (gaining of oxygen- when oxygen is metabolized it created free radicals- which steal electrons form other molecules, causing damage)
<br>
<b>Recommended intakes: </b>RDA for men and women = 19mg
<br>
<b>Sources: </b>Seeds, nuts, vegetable oils and fortified breakfast cereals
<br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> Non toxic, but large doses from supplements may interfere with blood clotting UL = 1,000mg of supplements however some studies have shown increased mortality with lower doses Deficiency is rate in healthy people Manifests as hemolytic anemia – red blood cells are destroyed and remove from bloodstream before normal lifespan is over – because of lack of VE to protect them from oxidation
<br>
<br>
K: Phylloquinone, Mengaquinones
<b>Function:</b> assists in blood clotting, aids bone formation
</br>
<b>Recommended intakes: </b>AI for men = 120micrograms women = 90 micrograms
</br>
<b>Sources: </b>Brussels sprouts, broccoli, spinach, other leafy green vegetables, black-eyes peas, soybeans – additional from normal bacteria thriving in colons - animals foods contain LITTLE amount
</br>
<b>Too much/ too little:</b> Toxicity and deficiency = rare Deficiency causes impaired blood clotting Suboptimal intakes linked to reduced bone density and increased risk fractures
