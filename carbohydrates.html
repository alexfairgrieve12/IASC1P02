      <p id="title">Carbohydrates</p>

  		<p class="text">There are two types of carbs, simple carbs, which are plant carbs made up of either one sugar, a monosaccharide or 2 sugars a disaccharide
The second type of carb is complex carb which are carbs that contain more than two sugar molecules. There are Oligosaccharides, short sugar chains, monosaccharaides, carbon sugar of 10+ sugars, and olysaccharides which include starch, long chain of glucose molecules (Storage form of glucose for grains, tubers (underground growths containing plants nutrients), legumes/ used during plants growth and reproduction. The way that glucose molecules link together make them digestible (starch) or non-digestible (fiber). Fiber is non digestible glucose / long chains of glucose bounded together. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose, it is not dietary source of carb (we don’t eat it), it is quickly broken down after an animal is slaughtered and it can be broken down in the body to provide energy
</br>
</br>
In Body glucose is the primary fuel 4 cells, brain, nervous system, red blood cells and placenta and fetus. glucose enters the cells and metabolic reactions convert it to CO2, water and ATP, energy. If there is more glucose than the body needs it is stored as glycogen through a process called GLYCOGENOLSIS and is stored in liver and skeletal muscle. During fasting / sleeping / drop in blood sugar the liver breaks down glycogen into glucose and glucose is released into blood. When the liver and skeletal muscle full are full the glucose is stored as fat and used when needed. When there is a low amount of carbs and glycogen stores are depleted protein, from diet, skeletal muscle and organs, gets converted into glucose through a process called GLUCOGENESIS, for energy to maintain blood glucose. This results in muscle loss, problems with immunity and other functions of protein in body. The cells need a bit of carbs to break down fat. When there is not enough carbs the liver produces ketone bodies which eventually build up to unsafe levels in blood causing ketosis. Ketosis can cause blood to become too acidic and body can become dehydrated
</br>
</br>
RDA (recommended dietary allowance) = 130g / average minimum amount of carbs used by the brain
</br>
</br>
AMDR = acceptable macronutrient dietary range = 45-65% of calories per day
</br>
</br>
The Glycemic index ranks carb containing food from 0 – 100. A foods score indicates the increase in blood glucose from a single food containing 50 GRAMS of carbs compared to 50 GRAMS of PURE GLUCOSE which as GI score of 100. Low GI scores = foods that are slowly digested and absorbed. High GI scores = quickly digested and absorbed – spike the blood with glucose. Factors influencing GI score are the degree of ripeness of piece of fruit (riper = higher score) the amount and type of processing food has gone through, whether food is eaten RAW or COOKED and how much presence of FAT vinegar and other acids there is. High calorie low nutrient foods such as candy, chocolate bars, ice cream have desirable GI scores. Nutritious foods like dates bake potatoes have high GI scores. Healthy foods depend on nutrient density no type of carbs or GI score.

</br>
Fiber provides phytochemicals which protect plant from infection and us from chronic disease. Hues aromas and flavors of plant suggest that it contains phytochemicals. Phytochemicals stimulate immune system, slow the rate at which cancer cells grown and prevent damage to DNA. Foods rich in fiber are rich in carbs.
</br>
</br>
Recommended intake for fiber:  men = 38g women = 25g
