  		<p id="title">Fat</p>

  		<p class="text">Fats in the body slows down digestion and provide 9 kcal. They are an energy reserve because the body only store small amounts of glucose and glycogen for energy but stores unlimited amounts of energy as fat tissue. We use this store energy during sleeping, periods of low energy and during physical activity. They provide essential fatty acids. FA differ chemically by the length of carbon chains, degree of saturation (how many hydrogen atoms are bound to carbon) and location of carbon-carbon double bonds. Body can produce most needed FAs but the 2 FAs it cant are LA (linoleic acid) and ALA (alpha linolenic acid) which makes them essential. FAs are important parts of cell membranes because they are converted to chemical regulators that affect inflammation, blood clotting blood vessel dilation and more. A deficiency in LA is usually seen in people with sever mal-absorption problems. Fats carry fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins, disease fighting phytochemicals and they add to the texture and flavor of foods by dissolving flavor, volatile chemicals which add a rich creamy texture and they provide tenderness and moistness to baked goods.
</br>
</br>
Lipids are mixtures of fatty acids and there is no RDA or AI (adequate intake) for any population except infants. AI for infants = 30-31g, AMDR = 20-35% for men and women age 19 +, AMDR for kids is higher and varies by age = starting 30-40% for kids 1-3 / gradually approaching the AMDR for adults. Experts discourage low fat intakes for infants, toddlers and young kids because fat is energy dense making it appropriate for small, finicky appetites and to support growth and developing central nervous system . AI’s for LA and ALA for adults = 11-17g and 1.1 – 1.6g
</br>
</br>
Body can make all the saturated FAs it needs which means we don’t need any from diet. High intakes of it are linked to high levels of LDL low – density lipoprotein or bad cholesterol and reduced insulin sensitivity. We should limit intakes of SFA to 10% of total calorie intakes to reduce LDL cholesterol and our risk for heart disease. The American heart association recommends that saturated fat be 7% of total calories. If you tried to eat NO SFA you would find that you had little to eat. Many SF are solid at room temperature, dairy fats and tropical oils (coconut, palm, pal kernel) are largely saturated
</br>
</br>
Food manufacturers create saturated and trans fat when they HARDEN oil. This process is called hydrogenation = to increase self like. Hydrogenation converts some but not all unsaturated fatty acids to saturated ones. Others remain unsaturated but are changed in chemical structure. These are health damaging trans fats. Lower HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). American heart association recommends that we keep trans FA intake to less than 1% of total calories
</br>
</br>
Unsaturated fats improve blood cholesterol levels and insulin sensitivity. There are 2 classes: Monounsaturated = avocado, nuts, seeds, olives and Polyunsaturated, based on where the double bond is on the chain of FAs, Omega-3 FA = walnuts, ground flaxseed, tofu, soybeans, cooking oils (ALA), From ALA body makes two other critically important omega 3 Fas (EPA and DHA) – conversion is very inefficient. Better to get EPA and DHA from fish – important to the heart – visual acuity and brain development in fetus infant and child – slow rate of cognitive decline in elderly may decreased symptoms associated with arthritis, ulcerative colitis and other inflammatory diseases – bluefish, herring, lake trout, mackerel, salmon, sardines and tuna. Omega-6-Fas – LA – sunflower seeds, Brazil nuts, pecans and pin nuts, corn sunflower, safflower and sesame oils.
